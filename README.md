# Leetcode-solutions

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a platform that provides a wide range of coding challenges to help you improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## About LeetCode

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. It offers many problems across multiple domains such as algorithms, data structures, databases, shells, and more. Each problem typically comes with a description, example test cases, and a platform for you to write and test your code.

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my solutions to LeetCode problems. By sharing my solutions, I hope to:

- Help others understand different approaches to solving the same problem.
- Provide a resource for learning and studying algorithms and data structures.
- Document my progress as I continue to solve more problems on LeetCode.

## Folder Structure

The solutions are organized into the following folders with the Python files and README.md file inside each folder structure. README.md contains the problem description whereas python contains the solution to the problem described in the README.md file.
