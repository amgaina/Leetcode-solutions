# Leetcode-solutions

Welcome to the LeetCode Solutions repository! This repository contains my solutions to various LeetCode problems. LeetCode is a platform that provides a wide range of coding challenges to help you improve your algorithmic problem-solving skills.

## About LeetCode

LeetCode is a platform for preparing technical coding interviews. It offers a vast collection of problems across multiple domains such as algorithms, data structures, database, shell, and more. Each problem typically comes with a description, example test cases, and a platform for you to write and test your code.

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to showcase my solutions to LeetCode problems. By sharing my solutions, I hope to:

- Help others understand different approaches to solving the same problem.
- Provide a resource for learning and studying algorithms and data structures.
- Document my progress as I continue to solve more problems on LeetCode.

## Folder Structure

The solutions are organized into following files with their purpose. They are listed below: 
## maxArea.py -> 
You are given an integer array height of length n. There are n vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ith line are (i, 0) and (i, height[i]).
Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.
Return the maximum amount of water a container can store.
Notice that you may not slant the container.
